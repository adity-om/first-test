# first-test
its just an attempt to learn github basics. Now I just learnt how to create a branch from a master branch. Generally the parallel branch is called a feature. after the feature is ready. We merge the feature with the initial master branch. 
commit is term used to describe a saved change.
commit message is a message used to describe a commit, its purpose to a user other than the creator of the code.
